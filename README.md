# Welcome to GitHub CorvusGameLab-URPGrass-Shader!

This shader only works with the URP-Engine. Make sure it is active in your Unity project. Else, the Grass will be purple and wont work.
I hope the shader is to your satisfaction. 
If you want to support me, I would be happy about a subscription to my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzVARE0odlpF0bqvNAFIFJg).
If you improve the shader, you are welcome to share your code under my YouTube video or via Github.

This shader is mainly based on Daniel Ilett's "Breath of the Wild" Grass Shader (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyW_aYE82s).
It also includes parts of Minions Art Geometry Grass Shader for URP (https://www.patreon.com/posts/geometry-grass-47447321).

Current shader made by Corvus Game-Lab.
