# Welcome to GitHub CorvusGameLab-URPGrass-Shader!

This shader only works with the URP-Engine. Make sure it is active in your Unity project. Else, the Grass will be purple and wont work.
I hope the shader is to your satisfaction. 
If you want to support me, I would be happy about a subscription to my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzVARE0odlpF0bqvNAFIFJg).

This shader is mainly based on Daniel Ilett's "Breath of the Wild" Grass Shader (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyW_aYE82s).
It also includes parts of Minions Art Geometry Grass Shader for URP (https://www.patreon.com/posts/geometry-grass-47447321).
