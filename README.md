# Welcome to GitHub CorvusGameLab-URPGrass-Shader!
SetUp: 
1. Download the folder from Github
2. Make sure you are using the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) in your project 
3. Drag the folder into your projects asset folder
4. Rightclick on the URP-CorvusGrassShader and create a new material.
5. Add the WindMap texture to its designated place. 

This shader is mainly based on Daniel Ilett's "Breath of the Wild" Grass Shader (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyW_aYE82s).

It also includes parts of Minions Art Geometry Grass Shader for URP (https://www.patreon.com/posts/geometry-grass-47447321).

This shader only works with the URP-Engine. Make sure it is active in your Unity project. Else, the Grass will be purple and wont work.
If you want to support me, I would be happy about a subscription to my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzVARE0odlpF0bqvNAFIFJg).
If you improve the shader, you are welcome to share your code under my YouTube video or via Github.
I hope the shader is to your satisfaction. 

Current shader made by Corvus Game-Lab.
